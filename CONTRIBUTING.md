First off, thank you for considering contributing! It's people like you that make the Haskell community awesome.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
* Check the Issues tab to see if the bug has already been reported.
* If not, open a new issue. Include your OS (especially if you're on a T-480 or similar laptop) and steps to reproduce the glitch.

### Suggesting Enhancements
* Want to add a new activation function (like ReLU or Tanh)?
* Want to improve the Gloss rendering performance?
* Open an issue first to discuss the change!

### Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add some examples.
3. Ensure your Haskell code is formatted cleanly.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Style Guide
* We prefer clean, readable functional pipelines.
* Keep the math explicit—don't hide the neural net logic behind too many abstractions.
* If you change the UI, make sure it still fits on smaller laptop screens!
